    text: "We've all seen the news about climate change.  But, did you know that digital technology accounts for around 3% of global Green House Gas (GHG) emissions? Also, every year JP Morgan produces 730,171 mtCO2e per year (approx. 73 times traveling round the earth on a plane).  This is unsustainable.  There are several green initiatives within the firm, but none are looking at the carbon emissions of our software."

    title: "Solution"
    text: "We created a framework to measure, analyze and identify key findings on how to improve the greenness of software applications.  The Carbon Reduction Lifecycle allows us (EcoDreamers) to generate, collect, and analyze application carbon data through a python library called CodeCarbon which emits carbon telemetry data which is analysed through a machine learning algorithm to identify an application's top carbon contributing factors.  Engineers can then act upon these findings to improve their carbon efficiency."
