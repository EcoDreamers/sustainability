    text: "We've all seen the news about climate change.  But, did you know that digital technology accounts for around 3% of global Green House Gas (GHG) emissions? Also, every year JP Morgan produces 730,171 mtCO2e per year (approx. 73 times traveling round the earth on a plane).  This is unsustainable.  There are several green initiatives within the firm, but none are looking at the carbon emissions of our software."
